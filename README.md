## 📚 Topics Covered

Here is the list of topics I have learned and practiced:

1. **First Program**  
   - Writing the first "Hello World" program and understanding its structure.

2. **Variables and Datatypes**  
   - Declaring variables and exploring Java's data types.

3. **Comments, Literals, and Type Conversion**  
   - Writing single-line and multi-line comments, working with literals, and understanding implicit/explicit type conversion.

4. **Getting Inputs**  
   - Using the `Scanner` class for user input and handling data.

5. **Arithmetic Operators**  
   - Performing basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

6. **Relational Operators**  
   - Working with comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, and `!=`.

7. **Bitwise Operators**  
   - Performing bitwise operations using AND, OR, XOR, and complement operators.

8. **Short Circuit Operators and Operator Precedence**  
   - Understanding logical operators (`&&`, `||`) and precedence rules in expressions.

9. **Increment/Decrement Operations**  
   - Exploring tricky questions and scenarios using `++` and `--`.

10. **If-Else Statements**  
    - Writing conditional statements for decision-making.

11. **If-Else Programs and Problem-Solving**  
    - Solving CodeSignal problems and implementing logic with `if-else`.

12. **Switch Statements**  
    - Using switch cases for cleaner and more efficient branching.

13. **Arrays**  
    - Declaring, initializing, and manipulating arrays in Java.

14. **Loops**  
    - Mastering loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) for iterative operations.

15. **Nested Loops**  
    - Writing nested loops to handle complex logic and multi-dimensional arrays.

16. **Loop Control Statements**  
    - Using `break` and `continue` to control loop flow.

17. **Arrays and Loops (Solving Problems)**  
    - Combining arrays and loops to solve LeetCode-style problems.

18. **For-Each Loop**  
    - Iterating through arrays and collections using enhanced `for` loops.

19. **OOP Concepts**  
    - **Classes and Objects**: Understanding class structure and creating objects.  
    - **Methods**: Writing reusable methods with parameters and return types.  
    - **Method Overloading**: Implementing multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.  

20. **Constructors**  
    - Understanding constructors and their usage in object initialization.

21. **This Pointer**  
    - Using `this` keyword to reference the current object.

22. **Garbage Collector and Finalize**  
    - Exploring memory management and the `finalize` method.

23. **Stack Implementation**  
    - Writing stack operations and implementing stacks using arrays.

24. **Passing Objects and References**  
    - Passing objects and references to methods and understanding their behavior.

25. **Returning Objects**  
    - Writing methods that return objects and their applications.
